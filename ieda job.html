                            <b>The job is Senior C++ Engineer.</b>
                          <ul>
							<li>This job requires development ,write C++ code and test it, also need to lead other engineers. The work is based in an office building in Port Melbourne.</li>
							<li>The job provides exposure to the development process of Hollywood special effects production software(Blackmagic Fusion), and also work with many good software engineers.</li>
                                <li>I think the most appealing part of this job is the access to different film crews, because we need to learn from these professionals about the needs of filmmaking.</li>
                                  <li>The job also gives me the opportunity to develop graphics rendering engines and improve my own programming skills, because I can talk to other great developers.</li>
                               <li>This career requires more than five years of experience in C++ development, as well as knowledge of different scripting languages and outstanding computer graphics. The key thing is that this job requires a PhD degree.</li>
                             <li>In addition to the above requirements, this career also requires excellent collaboration skills and experience in cross-platform development.</li>
                           <li>Nowdays, I only have a very basic C programming skill and only know how to create a simple web page. My collaboration skills are not very well. It's not just that I rarely work with others, our high school doesn't require us to work with others on assignments either.</li>
                                <li>Obviously, I currently only have a high school education, which doesn't meet the requirements.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <b>To got this job:</b>  
                            <ul>   
                             <li>Firstly, I would need to complete a bachelor's degree, followed by a master's degree. Since a PhD is very difficult, I will consider it further after completing a Master's degree.</li>
                             <li>Secondly, I would also step up my collaboration with others during this time to complete assignments and extracurricular interests, such as attendance at career seminars. Also, Being more proactive in communicating with others</li> 
                              <li>Thirdly, I also need to become proficient in C++, which means. I'm going to be doing a lot of practice. This can be done through programming classes, searching for topics online and finding part-time programming jobs</li>
                                <li>Foudly, I will learn a scripting language in year two holidays. I currently choose to study Python.</li>
                               <li>Fifth, I would complete advanced maths in my first year holiday which is very helpful in improving logical thinking.</li>
                              <li>In the end, I decided to look for an internship with a company in my final year (if I think I'm good enough). This is a good way to get work experience.</li>
                              </ul>
