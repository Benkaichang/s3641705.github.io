            <ul>
				<li>I really like computer graphics. I first became interested in computers when I was in elementary school.</li>
				 <li>I got interested in IT because my father liked to read computer magazines, and I was influenced by him to read them and find IT interesting.</li>
                  <li>However, I don't have much computer experience, this is because I rarely used a computer until university. I had a very hard time in high school.<br>Talking about my computer knowledge. I only know very basic C program, HTML and Css. I'm not very good with linux and Mac OS at the moment.</li>
                 <li>There are three reasons for choosing RMIT. The first is that RMIT attaches great importance to employability skills, which I think will be of great help to my future.<br>The second reason is RMIT is right in the city, which helps me save time so that I can concentrate on my studies. If the school is in the suburbs, I may have to spend a lot of time on public transport.<br>
                    The final point is that my academic performance is not enough to go to other school.(ðŸ˜‚)</li>
                <li>During my studies. I want to understand how computers work, improve my cooperation and English skills. In addition, I also want my math skills, logical thinking and social skills to be much improved.</li>
