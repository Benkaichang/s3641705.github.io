            <ul>
				<li>I really like computer graphics. I first became interested in computers when I was in elementary school.</li>
				 <li>I got interested in computers because my father liked to read computer magazines, and I was influenced by him to read them and find IT interesting.</li>
                  <li>I don't have much computer experience, in fact, I rarely used a computer until college because I had a very hard time in high school.<br>I find it hard to evaluate my computer knowledge. On the programming side I only know very basic C.</li>
                 <li>There are two reasons for choosing RMIT. The first is that RMIT attaches great importance to employability skills, which I think will be of great help to my future.<br>The second point is that my academic performance is not enough to go to other school.(ðŸ˜‚)</li>
                <li>I want to understand how computers work and how to achieve those nice graph. Of course, I also want my math skills, logical thinking and social skills to be much improved.</li>

             <p>The job is Senior C++ Engineer.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>This job provides exposure to the development process of Hollywood special effects production software, and also work with many good software engineers.</li>
                 <li>This job will also allow me to further my GUI development skills, as I don't think I'm very good at that.</li>
                  <li>This career requires more than five years of experience in C++ development, as well as knowledge of different scripting languages and computer graphics. The most crucially this job requires a doctor degree.</li>
                   <li>In addition to the above requirements, this career requires excellent collaboration skills and experience in cross-platform development.</li>
                    <li>I only have a very basic grasp of C programming, my collaboration skills are not very good, and my degree is only from high school.</li>
                   <li>I would need to complete a bachelor's degree first, followed by a master's degree. Since a PhD is very difficult, I will consider it further after completing a Master's degree.</li>
                   <li>I would also step up my collaboration with others during this time to complete assignments and extracurricular interests. I also plan to become proficient in C++ and computer graphics and get an internship in an IT company.</li>
                  <li>Eventually, I need to learn and become proficient in a scripting language, but that language I'll choose as needed. In addition, maths is also very important and I will be completing advanced maths over the holidays to make sure I can think logically enough.</li>
