                                    <h2>Overview</h2>
							        <p>This is a new rendering engine that can overcome the limitations of existing 3D rendering engines, allowing creators such as game developer to save time and money on production. Today's game engines and animation rendering engines are using the rasterization. This is a step of converts 3D information into 2D information and displays it on the screen, but there are some parts of this method that require a lot of developer time. This new engine reduces development time by automating these steps and providing a new solution. This will dramatically change the way games are made today.</p>
									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>According to Gamedesigning’s report (Gamedesigning 2020), the 2 most popular game engines today are Unreal Engine and Unity. This means that most commercial game titles are developed by both engines. These development tool allows the game developer to go directly into building the game environment, thus significantly reducing the total development time and cost. However, game development is still becoming more and more expensive these days. According to the cost of games report (Koster 2018), the cost of developing games has increased by more than 22 times, which means that we continue to use traditional techniques to develop games which will inevitably become more expensive. The big reason (Steve 2018) for this is that games are becoming more complex and people are spending more time making them. For example, baking details into textures and testing them is very computationally intensive and time-consuming. Also, 3D models are becoming more complex and time consuming as a result. In summary, if we can make an engine that doesn't need to do texture baking, then we can greatly reduce development time and costs.</p>
									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>This engine has two-part, traditional graphics pipeline and the new texturing, polygon processing technology. Almost all rendering engines now follow this step, the Application Stage, the Geometry Stage and the Rasterizer Stage. The new engine will still take these same approaches as the traditional engine. However, the traditional approach has limitations. Due to the limited performance of a single device, it is impossible to render a large number of polygons at the same time, so in the past developers would design many models with different precision. When the user is farther away from an object, this model switches from a high polygon model to a low polygon model. As the distance gets further away, the lowest polygon model will disappear. However, making multiple models of varying complexity is very time consuming and the development costs should become higher, so our new engine is going to be able to do this step with just one model. This new engine automatically adjusts the number of polygons based on the user's distance from the target model through a specific algorithm. This eliminates the need for developers to create multiple models or manually set the rendering range of their work. In addition to this, there is another benefit that this technology can bring. Since the number of models is limited, developers will now render a large amount of detail onto the texture. This allows more detail to be shown on the model and requires a lot of performance to implement. Our new engine makes such detailed textures less important, because it can dynamically adjust the number of polygons. When the object is visible and close enough to the user, it is possible to render a large amount of detail directly from the model with the highest accuracy. Finally, there is another step in the traditional rendering method called Rasterizer. this technique pairs the polygon coordinates with the user's screen resolution, gets an average value, and then displays it according to the calculated monitor pixels’ coordinates. This step also requires a significant amount of computer performance. To solve this issue, our new engine can dynamically aligns the number of polygons with the number of pixels on the user's monitor, which will reduce this performance overhead.</p>
									<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
									<p>In order to develop this engine, we need to use the C++ language. This is because C++ allows for infrastructure development. In addition, development requires the use of Microsoft Visual Studio, which is the most commonly used C++ development tool. Graphics discovery requires developers to use Microsoft's DirectX 12 API and the latest version of Vulkan because only DirectX 12 and the latest Vulkan support Mesh Shader, a technology that improves polygon drawing efficiency. Developing this software requires powerful graphics workstations. These graphics workstations are used to test the amount of data that the engine can use and the final graphics that can be achieved.</p>
									<h2>Skills Required</h2>
									<p>Developers need to demonstrate a deep understanding of the C++ language, algorithms, and the use of graphical APIs. In addition to this, developers need to know advanced physics because the engine needs to calculate physical information such as lighting, which makes physics very important. Currently, since computers are very popular professions, this makes the number of people with these skills very high. Finding these people is not very difficult.</p>
                                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
									<p>If this engine is successfully put to use, it will change the way existing games are developed. Developers no longer need to spend a lot of time baking textures and setting up visual scopes. The artists who also make the models can make just one model, rather than multiple. Finally, due to the ever-increasing computer hardware, the game content has become more complex. It would be extremely difficult to develop the game in the traditional way. This new engine will be more suitable for the next few years by automating some of the processes and significantly reducing the developer's workload.</p>
