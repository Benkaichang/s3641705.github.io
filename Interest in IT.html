										<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
									</header>

									<ul>
										<li>I prefer computer graphics, machine learning and cloud coumpting. I'm considering a career in game development or machine learning. These two careers have link to my hobbits, so I want to do it.</li>
										 <li>I first got interested in computers when I was in primary school grade 5. In fact, I've been using coumpter since I was 4 year old. I got interested in IT because my father liked to read computer magazines, and I was influenced by him to read them and find IT interesting. After that I even paid for these magazines myself to read. When I later owned my own computer, I even took it apart and try to install back.</li>
										  <li>However, I don't have much computer experience, this is because I rarely used a computer until university. I had a very hard time in high school.<br>I'm not computer literate enough. I only know very basic C program, HTML and CSS. I'm not very good with linux and Mac OS at the moment.</li>
										 <li>There are three reasons for choosing RMIT. The first is that RMIT attaches great importance to employability skills, which I think will be of great help to my future.<br>The second reason is RMIT is right in the city, which helps me save time so that I can concentrate on my studies. I may have to spend a lot of time on public transport when the school in suburbs.<br>
											The final point is that my academic performance is not enough to go to other school.</li>
										<li>In simple terms, I'd like to understand how computers work, improve my cooperation and English skills. In addition, I also want my math skills, logical thinking and social skills to be much improved. It would certainly be best if there was an opportunity to work in one of the computer fields later on.</li>
									    <li>In detail, I want to learn 2 programming languages, C++ and JAVA, and I can use algorithms and mathematics to implement some complex program functions. I also want to learn Python, which a scripting language that seems to be very popular. In addition, I would like to work with people from different countries so that I can be more responsive to others, because I'm not very good at expressing my own views.</li>
									</ul>
