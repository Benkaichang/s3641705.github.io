										<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
									</header>

									<ul>
										<li>I really like computer graphics. I first became interested in computers when I was in primary school.</li>
										 <li>I got interested in IT because my father liked to read computer magazines, and I was influenced by him to read them and find IT interesting. After that I even paid for these magazines myself to read. When I later owned my own computer, I even took it apart and try to install back.</li>
										  <li>However, I don't have much computer experience, this is because I rarely used a computer until university. I had a very hard time in high school.<br>Talking about my computer knowledge. I only know very basic C program, HTML and Css. I'm not very good with linux and Mac OS at the moment.</li>
										 <li>There are three reasons for choosing RMIT. The first is that RMIT attaches great importance to employability skills, which I think will be of great help to my future.<br>The second reason is RMIT is right in the city, which helps me save time so that I can concentrate on my studies. If the school is in the suburbs, I may have to spend a lot of time on public transport.<br>
											The final point is that my academic performance is not enough to go to other school.(ðŸ˜‚)</li>
										<li>During my studies. I want to understand how computers work, improve my cooperation and English skills. In addition, I also want my math skills, logical thinking and social skills to be much improved. It would certainly be best if there was an opportunity to work in one of the computer fields later on.</li>
									</ul>
